A collection of JavaScript utilities. Inspired by [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/).

The goals of this project are:

- Make a utility library like Lodash or Underscore
- CommonJS and _only_ CommonJS
- You should be able to `require` only the pieces you need
- Small file size is more important than performance
- Optimize for "normal" cases, not edge cases
