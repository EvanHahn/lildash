Contributing guidelines
=======================

Feel free to fix bugs, improve documentation, or add features. If you're not sure what to do, that's fine! Please add an issue and we'll get you rolling.

If you're adding a feature, make sure that you do four things:

1. Make sure it fits with the project guidelines. If you're not sure whether it's wanted and there isn't an issue for it, feel free to add one.
2. Add the feature.
3. Add tests for the feature.
4. Add JSDoc documentation for the feature.

Thanks for contributing!
